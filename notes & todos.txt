- NOTE: We need to deploy the MakeItSo.exe.config file



Version 1.1
-----------  
- VS2010 parser
- Auto-detect VS version from the .sln file  
- Ability to add or suppress compiler flags
- Projects with property sheets, and inherited properties
- Make path to cygwin configurable for the tester
- Output target names might not be the same as project names.
- 32-bit vs 64-bit generation?
- Config option to suppress checking in current folder for dlls. 


Version 1.2
-----------
- Custom build steps
- Pre / post build steps
- Allow change to folder prefix "gcc" (maybe v 1.2) 


Version 2.0
-----------
- C# / mono


Tests
-----
- Test 'absolute references' in C#
- Find out if you can implcitly link to projects that don't have 
  the same configuration names (e.g. Debug, Debug32)
- Find out what happens if you have a refernce in C# to a project
  that has different configuration names.

BUGS
----
- OnDemandPriceLogger: fails with 'Value cannot be null'


C# / Mono
---------
- Debug_FLAGS = -warn:4 -warnaserror+ -nowarn:1701,1702 -debug+ -debug:full -filealign:512 -pkg:dotnet -define:DEBUG -define:TRACE -optimize-   
- Release_FLAGS = -warn:4 -warnaserror+ -nowarn:1701,1702 -filealign:512 -pkg:dotnet -define:TRACE -optimize+ 

- Is there any harm in always doing copy-local?
  - We should only do this if the setting says to.
  - If we do it, we should copy project references from the copied from project as well(?)
