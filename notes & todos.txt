2010 notes
----------
- Need to work out how to do the combined libs thing in VS2010
  - The VS2008 technique doesn't seem to work.


VS 2010
-------  
- VS2010 parser
- Auto-detect VS version from the .sln file  
- Ability to add or suppress compiler flags
- Projects with property sheets, and inherited properties
- Make path to cygwin configurable for the tester
- Output target names might not be the same as project names.
- 32-bit vs 64-bit generation?
- Config option to suppress checking in current folder for dlls. 


Custom build steps etc
----------------------
- Custom build steps
- Pre / post build steps
- Allow change to folder prefix "gcc" (maybe v 1.2)
