Tests
-----
- C# test using a custom control

C# / Mono
---------
- Debug_FLAGS = -warn:4 -warnaserror+ -nowarn:1701,1702 -debug+ -debug:full -filealign:512 -pkg:dotnet -define:DEBUG -define:TRACE -optimize-   
- Release_FLAGS = -warn:4 -warnaserror+ -nowarn:1701,1702 -filealign:512 -pkg:dotnet -define:TRACE -optimize+ 

- Is there any harm in always doing copy-local?
  - We should only do this if the setting says to.
  - If we do it, we should copy project references from the copied from project as well(?)
