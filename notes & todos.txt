- NOTE: We need to deploy the MakeItSo.exe.config file

2010 notes
----------
- First (non-empty) line of solution: "Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 11.00"
  - VS2008 line:                      "Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 10.00"

- Refactor code so that adding/removing preprocessor definitions is not in the parser.
  - Should be a common step after the parsing stage
  - Also for libs etc.

- Make it so that the parser assmebly is dynamically loaded
  - We only load the version we need.
  - This may help with assembly-conflict problems
  - It should also help if you don't have the correct VS version installed.

VS 2010
-------  
- VS2010 parser
- Auto-detect VS version from the .sln file  
- Ability to add or suppress compiler flags
- Projects with property sheets, and inherited properties
- Make path to cygwin configurable for the tester
- Output target names might not be the same as project names.
- 32-bit vs 64-bit generation?
- Config option to suppress checking in current folder for dlls. 


Custom build steps etc
----------------------
- Custom build steps
- Pre / post build steps
- Allow change to folder prefix "gcc" (maybe v 1.2) 



Tests
-----
- Test on a machine that only has VS2008 installed
- Test on a machine that only has VS2010 installed
  - Test without SP1 in both cases, as well as with it.
  - What happens if you try to parse a VS2010 solution, but only have VS2008 installed?
    - It probably won't work, but is the error message any good?
